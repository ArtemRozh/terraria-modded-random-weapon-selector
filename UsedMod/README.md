Source code of the mod used and its tmod. Too lazy to create a separate repository just for a small thing like this.  
But it's also important to this project, so it's here.  
How to use:
1. Load all the mods you need
2. Create a character and join any world
3. Use /listweapons command in chat (or any other command set in the code)
4. It would gather all data into a format that is set in one of the config files, including weapon sprites
